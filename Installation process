First Download the HR Schema Zip File from my github repository

https://github.com/sayedabu18/Oracle-Apex-Sample-Schema

After Download. Extract Downloaded zip file then go to inside of extracted folder path and execute following cmd:

sqlplus /nolog

SQL> conn sys as sysdba

connected

SQL> alter session set container=xepdb1 (Note: in my case i used oracle database 23xe that's why i used "xepdb1" But in your case pluggable database name 
might change depending on using enterprise or xe edition) 

SQL> @hr_install.sql

assign tablespace when prompt: Normally you can select USERS or if you define any other tablespace to assign hr schema to that tablespace
assign hr password when prompt as your requirements.

After few minuit the sample hr schema will added to your 21c xe database.

Congratualations.

Enjoy !!
